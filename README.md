I just deployed the first honeypot and didn't use another one
I encountered issues where the honeypot wasn't picking up anything
No attacks were dodged as a result and I couldn't detect anything
When I tried to run the command to grab a json, I could not.
Everything else in the lab went smoothly besides this instance.
